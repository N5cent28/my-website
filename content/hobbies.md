    When I'm not coding or discovering, you can usually find me chasing wind, exploring underwater, or throwing discs around! 🏄‍♂️🌊🏃‍♂️

### Wind Sports 

My love for wind-powered adventures started at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1do98CHFK_bMw7gcbxYwENh_iz35WgRai5JEaWBwYhsI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoofer Sailing Club</a>, where I've been teaching and volunteering since 2015. From basic dinghy lessons to advanced lightwind freestyle, helping others discover the joy of sailing has been incredibly rewarding.

This passion evolved into more extreme pursuits - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3mmMocFZTz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">windsurfing in summer</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/8ZxxVSNtA8s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carving up ice in winter</a>. There's nothing quite like harnessing the power of wind! Still working on those jumps, but the wipeouts make for great stories.

### Outdoor Exploration

The biosphere has always fascinated me. From [night diving with tarpin](https://youtu.be/HYuVcYvMoOk) to <a href="https://youtu.be/S-cWvG5vEPg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camping out on carribean islands</a>, the natural world helps me feel centered. My favorite moments include watching humbacks bubble feed on either side of our sailboat and [grizzly bears snatch salmon](videolink) in SE Alaska. 


### Ultimate Frisbee

This is where my bumps and bruises come from! I started playing at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOQnVWCAZam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison West HS</a>, where I learned that playing a fake sport is far easier than a competitive one. 

I played for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5vD3mwnhD-/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wisconsin Hodags</a> in college - most of my closest friendships were forged competing with those folks.

These days I play for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madisonradicals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Radicals</a>, where I get to dive around in front of actual fans! Still can't believe people pay to watch us throw frisbees around.

**Currently accepting suggestions for more hobbies that involve flying through air or gliding through water* 🚀
