When I'm not coding or building things, you can usually find me throwing discs, climbing rocks, or sliding down mountains!* 🏃‍♂️🧗‍♂️🏂

### Rock Climbing 

I started climbing at [Mount Mendota](https://recwell.wisc.edu/locations/climbing/) and spent a few months climbing at [BlocHaven](https://www.blochaven.com/) while in South Carolina (their coffee shop is amazing btw). These days you can find me at [Boulders](https://www.bouldersgym.com/) working on v3-4s and pretending I know what beta means.

### Snowboarding

I started riding with [Hoofers](https://www.hoofersns.org/) in college. Made it out to Winter Park and Copper Mountain a few times, where I discovered that Colorado's "green" runs are Wisconsin's "black diamonds" (who knew?).

When it's not snowing, I teach sailing at [Hoofers](https://www.hoofersailing.org/). Nothing beats a summer day on Lake Mendota!

### Ultimate Frisbee

This is where most of my bruises come from! I started playing at [Madison West HS](https://www.instagram.com/madisonwestultimate/), where I learned that running is more fun when you're chasing plastic. 

Played for the [Wisconsin Hodags](https://www.instagram.com/hodaglove/) in college - some of my best memories are from tournaments with those folks. Was honored to be nominated for the [Callahan Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsmigKE2v9U) in 2023.

These days I play for the [Madison Radicals](https://www.instagram.com/madisonradicals/), where I get to dive around in front of actual fans! Still can't believe people pay to watch us throw frisbees around.

**Currently accepting suggestions for more hobbies that involve throwing myself through the air* 🚀
