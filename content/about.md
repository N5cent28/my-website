I've always been fascinated by life in all its forms. Growing up with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DC0QFJAPNJt/?hl=en&img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than my fair share of injuries</a>, I developed a firsthand appreciation for human biology and resilience. This curiosity, combined with my love for math and physics, naturally led me to Biomedical Engineering at UW-Madison - a field where I wouldn't have to choose between my varied interests.

During my undergraduate years, I had the incredible opportunity to work in the <a href="https://scbrm.bme.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Lab</a>, where I dove deep into regenerative biology and neurodevelopment. It was during this time that I discovered my calling in bioinformatics. Just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3Blue1Brown's</a> elegant mathematical explanations, I found beauty in using code to solve complex biological problems. The excitement of partnering with others to tackle challenges through programming was unmatched - I realized I could make a much bigger impact with a keyboard than with a pipette.

This revelation led me to specialize in bioinformatics and computational biology. I've felt fortunate for the opportunity to contribute to research in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn7430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neurodevelopmental biology</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163.1809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancer genomics</a>, where I've helped advance our understanding of human health.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll find me exploring our diverse planet, listening to people's fastinating stories, and seeking new adventures. I believe in pushing myself to my limits while maintaining a balance between professional growth and personal fulfillment. Whether it's developing new bioinformatics tools or tackling life's challenges, I approach each opportunity with enthusiasm and dedication.
