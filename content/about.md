I've always been fascinated by how things work. Growing up, I was that kid who couldn't stop asking "why?" - especially about space and physics. I spent countless hours watching lectures from astrophysicists and reading books like [Welcome to the Universe](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691157245/welcome-to-the-universe), dreaming about black holes and quantum mechanics.

This curiosity led me to study Engineering Physics at UW-Madison, where I had the incredible opportunity to work in the [Kolkowitz Lab](https://kolkowitzlab.physics.wisc.edu/). There, I dove deep into quantum mechanics, working on improving atomic clock state estimation. It was during this time that I stumbled upon [3Blue1Brown's neural network video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - and just like that, I was hooked on machine learning. The way neural networks could learn patterns and make predictions felt like magic, but with math!

This newfound passion drove me to pursue my Master's in ECE, focusing on Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I've since had the chance to work on some amazing projects - from [modeling robotic arms](https://www.ara.com/sapper/) at Applied Research Associates to helping integrate AI into [SideShift's](https://www.sideshift.app/) platform.

When I'm not coding or tinkering with ML models, you'll find me staying active. I'm a professional Ultimate Frisbee player for the [Madison Radicals](https://watchufa.com/radicals) (yes, that's a thing!), and I love rock climbing and snowboarding.
