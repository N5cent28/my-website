**Summary**:
This study developed a novel method to generate diverse neurons from the posterior central nervous system (pCNS) using human pluripotent stem cells. The research established a modular differentiation approach that mimics natural development patterns, allowing the creation of region-specific neurons. Through extensive molecular analysis, including single-cell RNA sequencing, the study identified hundreds of genetic markers that help understand how these neurons develop and specialize.

**My Contribution**:
As an undergraduate researcher over two years, I conducted various molecular and imaging analyses, including:
- Quantitative real-time PCR (qrtPCR)
- RNA sequencing sample preparation
- Immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
- R1 Confocal microscopy imaging

**Abstract**:
This study investigates the role of GRHL2, a nuclear transcription factor, in hormone-positive breast cancer progression. Using a tetracycline-inducible MCF7 cell model, the research examines how GRHL2 overexpression affects genomic binding and chromatin landscape changes. The study focuses on understanding GRHL2's potential function as a pioneer factor and its impact on genes associated with cancer metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

**My Contribution**:
Working for Proteovista LLC, I led the bioinformatics analysis, including:
- Microarray data extraction and processing
- Creation of data visualizations for analysis
- Development of computational pipelines for data interpretation
