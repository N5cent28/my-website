ChessBot is an over-the-board training tool that mimics real-life chess play. The project combines mechanical engineering with software automation to create a seamless chess-playing experience.

### Technical Details
- Optimized for 18x18 cm chessboard
- 3D-printed rectangular prism pieces with magnetic bases
- Inverse kinematics computed using SciPy optimization
- Synchronized gripper mechanism for precise piece movement

### Implementation
- Python-based control system (83.5%)
- CMake configuration (9.4%)
- Jupyter Notebook analysis (7.1%)

### Future Development
- Computer vision integration for piece detection
- StockFish integration for automated move calculations
